After hitting enter or submit, the program will call the Quandl API for that data and format it as a dataframe. From here, the data is parsed so it can be visualized as a candlestick chart, dynamic moving average chart that changes its range based on the timeframe of the data, and a high-low graph. The trading volume is overlaid on the candlestick chart to provide additional context to price fluctuations. The graph is also interactive per matplotlibs traditional functionality."]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":false},"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","###########################################\n","#                                         #\n","#     Historical Stock Data API           #\n","#     and Visualizations                  #\n","#                                         #\n","#     Created By: Sam Showalter           #\n","#     Creation Date: 5/23/2017            #\n","#                                         #\n","###########################################\n","\n","\n","#Matplotlib related imports\n","import matplotlib\n","matplotlib.use(\"Qt5Agg\")     #MUST be Qt4Agg, otherwise mouse scroll events cause TkInter to crash\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from matplotlib import dates as mdates\n","import matplotlib.ticker as mticker\n","from matplotlib.finance import candlestick_ohlc\n","\n","#Other necessary modules for data and display\n","import quandl \n","from tkinter import *\n","import numpy as np\n","from pandas_datareader import data as web\n","import tkinter as tk\n","import datetime as dt\n","\n","#Authenticate the Quandl API with token\n","quandl.ApiConfig.api_key = 'N1j_H8avpLu-8zwvDdsH'\n","\n","class getHistorical():\n","    \n","    def __init__(self):\n","\n","       #INPUT TEXT BOXES\n","       self.root = tk.Tk()\n","       label1=tk.Label(self.root,text=\"Stock Ticker\")\n","       self.entry1=tk.Entry(self.root)\n","       label2=tk.Label(self.root,text=\"Start Date (YYYY-MM-DD)\")\n","       self.entry2=tk.Entry(self.root)\n","       value2 = self.entry2.get()\n","       label3=tk.Label(self.root,text=\"End Date (YYYY-MM-DD)\")\n","       self.entry3=tk.Entry(self.root)\n","       value1 = self.entry3.get()\n","\n","       #BUTTON\n","       button = tk.Button(self.root, text = 'Submit', command=self.quit, cursor = 'heart', relief = RAISED)\n","       self.root.bind('<Return>',lambda e: self.quit())\n","\n","       #PACKING IN ALL VALUES\n","       label1.pack()\n","       self.entry1.pack()\n","       label2.pack()\n","       self.entry2.pack()\n","       label3.pack()\n","       self.entry3.pack()\n","       button.pack()\n","\n","       #MESSAGES TO SHOW (PACKED)\n","       w = Message(self.root, text=\"Window will re-generate if improper inputs are given.
