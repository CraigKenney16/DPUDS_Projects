# Classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST data set

This exploration will use neural networks and tensorflow to examine how handwritten digits can be 
classified by computers.

Some resources to check out if you're interested in learning more about machine learning:

    1) http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html

    This project is heavily based on chapter 1, and will base much of its code on what the author provides for us. This
    is a great read for anyone who wants to learn more about machine learning/neural networks.

    2) https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners

    Although we will be building our neural network from scratch, TensorFlow provides a great neural network library
    and is great for people who don't want to get into the nitty gritty (i.e. mathematics) of machine learning.

    3) https://gist.github.com/akesling/5358964

    This is the code that our import_mnist.py file borrows from. I made a few changes to make it compatible with
    Python 3 and to make comments explaining what each part of it does.
