Clustering countries based on the alcohol consumption of their inhabitants. 

This project creates a general purpose clustering algorithm and uses it to compare countries based on alcohol consumption.
Code and data for this project was borrowed heavily from "Programming Collective Intelligence" by Toby Segaran
and abides by the stipulations specified in his work. 

Additions have been made to add a euclidian engine for the clustering processing as well as one that 
includes attributes from both a euclidian and Pearson coefficient.
